# AI-Assistant-Cohere
This project is an AI Assistant built using Python, integrating the Cohere API for natural language processing, PyQt5 for the graphical user interface, and SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 for voice interaction. The assistant can listen to voice commands, process them using Cohere, and respond back in a conversational manner.
